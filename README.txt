#R version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18) -- "World-Famous Astronaut"
#Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)


#####Instructions

# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#######Background on dataset
# The dataset has been split for machine learning (test and train components) so both test and train come from same DGP
#
# X_* is actual data, y_* is label of the activity they are doing (walking etc), subject_* identifies the subject
